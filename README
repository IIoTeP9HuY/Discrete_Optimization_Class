Introduction
============

There are my solutions for Programming Exercises from Coursera Discrete Optimization classes. Made in Python/C++/Java.

Collaboration Policy
==========

This class is a community and we encourage as much collaboration as possible within that community. However, to ensure the best learning experience for everyone, we must place some limits on what you can share. There are two guiding principles at the core of fair collaborations,

    Your code and algorithms should be your own.
    Do not share your solutions with anyone (including any public forum)

Both of these policies are designed to prevent students from skipping the coding part of the course, which is the essential learning component. Copying code goes as far as downloading binaries that solve the problem of any assignment. This is a core difference from general purpose optimization tools. Tools that solve a wide range of problems are permitted, but tools that are specialized to one specific problem constitute code sharing. You are not permitted to share your solutions because they can be easily used by other students to cheat.
